# Spam-Email-Detection-project
Our project, Email Spam and Ham Classification, focuses on addressing the challenge of identifying and filtering spam emails to improve email management and enhance user safety.

We utilized machine learning models to classify emails as either spam (unwanted) or ham (legitimate). By leveraging advanced algorithms—such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT)—we built a robust classification system.

The process involved:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and vectorizing email text using techniques like tokenization and TF-IDF.
Model Training: Applying machine learning models on labeled datasets.
Evaluation: Measuring performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.


This project contributes to the field by improving email filtering systems, reducing security threats, and ensuring a better user experience. Future enhancements may involve integrating the model into real-time email platforms for dynamic classification.
